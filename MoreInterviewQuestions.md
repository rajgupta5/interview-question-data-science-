**Explain the difference between Supervised and Unsupervised learning**
 
Supervised Learning involves algorithms that learn under the presence of a supervisor. Take image classification as an example, where the goal is to predict whether an image is a cat or a dog. The input is labelled data and our job is to correct the model when the output is wrong. We need to make sure that the model makes necessary updates so that the next time a cat image is shown to the model, it can correctly identify it.
 
Unsupervised learning is training the model using data that is neither classified nor labeled and enabling the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. The goal is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns and differences without any prior training of data.
